# Project Description

**AgriGuard: Smart Irrigation System** is a system designed to optimize irrigation by monitoring soil moisture levels. The system uses an ARM7 LPC2148 microcontroller to measure soil moisture through a potentiometer, display the data on an LCD, and control a motor for irrigation based on predefined thresholds.

## Features
- Real-time soil moisture monitoring
- Automated irrigation control
- LCD display for real-time data
- Expandable with additional sensors and IoT integration
